I have tested my site on multiple devices. These include:


- iPhone SE (375 x 667)
- iPhone XR plus (414 x 896)
- ipad mini (768 x 1024)
- iPad air (820 x 1180)
- nest hub max (1280 x 800)


the aim is to allow the website to resize itself and fit to any device as small as a iphone se (375 x 667) upto a nest hub max (1280 x 800) to allow for a great user experience.

## Mock-ups:

- Balsamiq was used to create wireframes of the website. This was very useful as it gives the template of the UI. Wireframes were designed for web browser and a mobile browser format. The concept design (wireframes) of webpages (3 pages) prepared is presented below.
